# Simulation-of-a-RISC-based-datapath-for-Booth-s-Algorithm
Booth’s algorithm is a multiplication algorithm used to multiply two binary numbers in two's complement notation. 


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write an assembly program to multiply 2 numbers one of which is in memory location X and the other in processor register R1 using Booth Algorithm. Store the result back in memory location Y. Design a RISC based datapath for the above and simulate the same using suitable tool.
Description:
Booth’s algorithm is a multiplication algorithm used to multiply two binary numbers in two's complement notation. 
The algorithm was invented by Andrew Donald Booth in 1950.
The Booth’s Algorithm involves following basic operations : 
1. Arithmetic right shifting
2. Binary addition
3. Binary subtraction using 2’s complement.
 To simulate the datapath we can use various hardware components such as, multiplexers, decoders, shift registers, counters, RAM etc. to store, retrieve and manipulate data.
RISC based datapath include 5 stage-operation
